    "# Application of this technique\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique has not been rigorsly studied to date.  I hold much promise and it is surprising that it generalizes as well as it does being trained in New Mexico Morrison sediments and applied to sediments in Utah.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be other uses for techniques such as these - some of whcih researchers are already working on, others are as yet untouched areas for study\n",

    "Below is a recent map showing the current fire hotspots in NM largest forest fire in its history - the Hermits Peak Fire. There is potential to apply similar AI process to identify highly susceptible burn regions\n",

    "### Energy Production/ State Regulatory\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest contributor to New Mexico's annual budget is related to energy prodction. New Mexico has vast regions of State owned land which are occasionally leased for energy production.  The state is tasked with overseeing 9 million surface acres and 13 million mineral acres. Enforcing or verifying regulatory compliance on such a vast scale is challenging. Reporting of energy unit production on State lands relies largely on an honor system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we apply similar AI methods to idenitfy areas of more recent utilization, via road or ground scarring to follow up on licensee(s) to ensure production is reported in a timely and accurate way?\n",
